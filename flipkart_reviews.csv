7,Good quality product,Camera : Decent camera. Don't expect much. I had Redmi note 9 pro max. Which has 64 mp and 32 mp camera back and front resp. The photo quality is inferior to that.  Low light photography is not advisable.  However in good lighting condition clicks nice.pics.Processor: Above average.  Played COD without any issue in media graphics settings. Battery: it seems like 5000mah while using. Doesn't seems to be extraordinary Battery. Although on paper it is 6000msh.Display: 90hz refresh rate is OK.READ MORE,4Good quality product,samsung-galaxy-f14-5g-goat-green-128-gb,4
